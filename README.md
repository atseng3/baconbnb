BellyGuide
BellyGuide is a Rails-based website that helps people keep track of restaurants they want to try, by organizing them in to-do lists.

Map

Create custom maps to keep track of where you've eaten and where you want to go.
Check out your global map with every restaurant you want to try.
Input your location to find somewhere close to you right now.
Eat

Check off restaurants as you visit them and take notes on your meals.
Filter your map's restaurants by category to find exactly what you want to eat.
Explore

Check out other users' maps and their eating accomplishments
If you see a restaurant you want to try, add it to one of your maps
Even clone a friend's entire map and set out on your own eating quest.
